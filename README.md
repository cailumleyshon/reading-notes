## 🔖 Concept of 'Growth Mindset':

A growth mindset is the belief that someone's abilities, intelligence, and qualities are not fixed, but can be developed through dedication and hard work. People with a growth mindset embrace challenges, learn from failure, and persist in the face of obstacles. This mindset encourages a love of learning and a focus on personal development.
A growth mindset is all about seeing setbacks as opportunities for growth. 3 reminders to sustain a growth mindset would be:

- Embrace challenges and use them as opportunity
- Learn from failure and use that knowledge to improve
- Stay positive and remain a 'can-do' attitude.

# 🔖 Introduction about myself...

Hi, my name is __Cailum__ and I live in Liverpool but I'm originally from the Peak District! 
I'm 23 and have lived in Liverpool for 5 years now. I love all things music and my favourite thing to do is go to gigs and festivals with my mates. Some of my favourite artists include Jack Johnson, Lana Del Rey, Shy FX and The Stone Roses.
