## Concept of 'Growth Mindset':

A growth mindset is the belief that someone's abilities, intelligence, and qualities are not fixed, but can be developed through dedication and hard work. People with a growth mindset embrace challenges, learn from failure, and persist in the face of obstacles. This mindset encourages a love of learning and a focus on personal development.
A growth mindset is all about seeing setbacks as opportunities for growth. 3 reminders to sustain a growth mindset would be:

- Embrace challenges and use them as opportunity
- Learn from failure and use that knowledge to improve
- Stay positive and remain a 'can-do' attitude.
