Markdown is favored over WYSIWYG editors for its *versatility* and *compatibility*. It finds use in web development, documentation, emails, presentations, and more. Markdown files are highly portable, opening in various applications and allowing easy migration between Markdown editors. Its platform independence means it's accessible on any device and operating system. Markdown offers future-proofing as its plain text format ensures readability even if the original app becomes obsolete. Lastly, Markdown's widespread support, from websites like Reddit and GitHub to numerous desktop and web apps, cements its position as a go-to choice for those valuing simplicity, consistency, and broad adoption in text-based content creation.
