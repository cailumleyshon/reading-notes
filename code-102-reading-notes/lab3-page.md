## "What did this exercise teach you?"

This exercise taught me to be more efficient with my GIT history and commiting. Prior to learning how to clone repo's onto my LVC, I was updating very minor details several times on GitHub which was making my commits go up with minimal change. Additionally, using the touch command in terminal, I have tidied up my files and folders giving my GitHub repository a cleaner look. Now that there are over 25 different files related to README.md, the folders make it a lot easier to keep track of where things are.
