## "What is HTML and why do we use it?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
HTML, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is a standard language for creating web pages. It's used to structure content on the internet, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML allows browsers to render web content consistently and enables developers to create and share information effectively across the web.

## "What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
An HTML element consists of three main parts: an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The opening tag, enclosed in angle brackets, defines the element's type. The content is the information or text enclosed between the opening and closing tags. The closing tag mirrors the opening tag but includes a forward slash before the element name. Together, these parts structure and define how the content should be displayed in a web browser, ensuring proper rendering and functionality on web pages.

## "What is it called when you give an element extra information?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you provide additional information to an HTML element, it's called adding **"attributes"**. Attributes are used within the opening tag of an element to provide extra details or configuration, such as specifying the source of an image **(src)**, defining the target of a link **(href)**, or setting various properties to control element behavior and appearance.

## "What is a semantic element?"

A semantic element in HTML is a tag that carries meaning about the content it encloses. It conveys the role or purpose of the content, aiding in both understanding by developers and accessibility by assistive technologies, promoting better structured and meaningful web documents. Examples include **<header>**, **<nav>**, and **<footer>**.
