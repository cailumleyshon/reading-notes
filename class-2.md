**1. Syntax Highlighting:** Helps identify code elements with color.
**2. Extensibility:** Supports a large number of plugins or extensions for customization (i.e. Emmets abbreviation).
**3. Code Completion:** Accelerates coding by suggesting and completing code snippets.
**4. Cross-Platform:** Works on multiple operating systems for flexibility.

##  Example Scenario Explained
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
```
cd projects
mkdir new-project
touch new-project/newfile.md
cd ..
ls projects/new-project
```
- cd projects: Change the current directory to the "projects" directory.
- mkdir new-project: Create a new directory named "new-project" within the "projects" directory.
- touch new-project/newfile.md: Create an empty Markdown file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.
- cd ..: Navigate back to the last directory.
- ls projects/new-project: List the contents of the "new-project" directory.

These commands are creating a new project folder, adding an empty Markdown file to it, and then checking the contents of the "new-project" directory to verify the file's presence.
